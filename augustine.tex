\section{Aporia} % (fold)
\label{sec:aporia}

Placed behind a protective grill facing the pavement on 111 Cannon Street resides the London Stone, or what remains of it. Composed of oolitic limestone, the London Stone is an unremarkable sight. The bronze plaque on the casing ends on an enigmatic note, ``Its origin and purpose are unknown but in 1188 there was a reference to Henry, son of Eylwin de Lundenstane, subsequently Lord Mayor of London''. Though its origin and purpose are forgotten, the degraded remnant of a Roman structure has exercised an enduring pull on the literary imagination. Thus in \emph{Henry \textsc{vi}, Part 2}, Shakespeare envisions Jack Cade, having led a rebellion and established himself as the Mayor of London, sitting astride the London Stone and administering rough justice. In \emph{Jerusalem}, William Blake casts it, instead, as a sacrificial alter of Druidic origin:
\begin{verse}
Where Albion slept beneath the Fatal Tree\\
And the Druids golden Knife,\\
Rioted in human gore,\\
In Offerings of Human Life\\
They groan'd aloud on London Stone
\end{verse}
I am struck by how poignant the unremarkable sight of the small block of limestone is in contrast with its obscurity and continuing power over the imagination.

Walking down Cannon Street, I turn, and look, and see the ancient stone. In the natural history of my so seeing, the stone, the object of my perception, figures prominently as a causal antecedent. The stone presents a rough appearance because the stone has that surface prior to its so appearing. And its rough gray surface, illuminated from above by the light of its casing, causes me to see that surface. This observation is perhaps the source of the long tradition of thinking of perception as a passive capacity. It is plausible, at the very least, that it is a materially necessary condition on a subject perceiving an object that the relevant sensory organs of the subject be acted upon, however mediately, by that object. Thus the London Stone must mediately alter my eyes---changing patterns of retinal stimulation, say---by altering the light in a complex subatomic process occurring at its surface.

I turn, and look, and see the ancient stone. The London Stone mediately acts upon my eyes by acting upon the illumination. And this is part of the natural history of my seeing the stone. Not only must my eyes be mediately acted upon by the stone, but my seeing the stone is an experience that I undergo. Even though my seeing of the stone is an experience that I undergo as a result of the stone mediately acting upon my eyes, my seeing of the stone is not something \emph{done} to me by the stone. It is \emph{I} that see the stone. It is I, and not the stone, that is doing the seeing. Even acknowledging the passive elements in the natural history and phenomenology of my perception (that the stone is the cause of my seeing it and that my seeing it is an experience that I undergo), there is a residual active element in my seeing. The stone may make itself seen, but my seeing of the stone is activity properly attributed to me and not the stone.

How are we to understand this?

For counsel we turn to Augustine's account of perception in \emph{De trinitate}. ``And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness'' \emph{Genesis} 1:26. Noting God's use of the plural form, Augustine understands a human being to be an image and likeness of the Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \emph{De trinitate}, rather nicely, itself constitutes a trinity consisting in three parts. In the first part, Augustine reviews the biblical evidence for the doctrine of the Trinity. In the second part, Augustine explains how there may be three equal persons each identical to the whole of a substance in terms of his theory of relations. In the third part, Augustine applies these results to the human mind conceived as an \emph{imago Dei}. And it is in the context of the project of this third part, to understand the human mind as an image of the trinitarian God, that Augustine provides an account of perception.

\section{The Perceptual Trinity} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_perceptual_trinity}

Augustine distinguishes three elements in perception. Though Augustine's example is vision, which he regards as exemplary, the trinitarian structure is meant to be exhibited by any perceptual apprehension of the external world:
\begin{quote}
	When we see a body, we have to consider and to distinguish the following three things, and this is a very simple task: first, the object which we see whether a stone, or a flame, or anything else that can be seen by the eyes, and this could of course, exist even before it was seen; secondly, the vision, which was not there before we perceived the object that was presented to the sense; thirdly, the power that fixes the sense of sight (\emph{sensus occulorum}) on the object that is seen as long as it is seen, namely, the attention of the mind (\emph{animi intentio}) (Augustine, \emph{De trinitate}, 11 2 2; \citealt[61--62]{Matthews:2002ly})
\end{quote}
In this passage, Augustine distinguishes between three things: (1) the object of perception, (2) perception, and (3) the attention of the mind (\emph{animi intentio}).

Let's consider these in turn:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item \emph{The object of perception}. The objects of at least visual perception include bodies and corporeal activities such as a stone or a flame. Moreover, Augustine at least suggests that the objects of visual perception may include entities from other ontological categories so long as they can be seen by the eyes. Augustine subscribes to a form of perceptual realism where the objects of perception may exist prior to perception (in contrast, for example, to the Secret Doctrine that Socrates attributes to Protagoras where the object of perception and the perceiver's perception of it are ``twin births'', Plato, \emph{Theaetetus}, 156 a--b). It is reasonable to suppose that the priority of the object of perception is both temporal and existential.
	\item \emph{Perception}. The second element, ``vision'', should not be understood as sight, the power to see, but rather its exercise, seeing. What was absent before the perceiver saw the object was not their power to see. Otherwise, it would not have been possible to come to see what they did, for they would have been blind. What was absent was not sight, but the seeing of the thing. It is not yet clear what Augustine takes perceptual activity to be. All we know so far is that it is the exercise of the soul's perceptual power and may take as an object a distal body or corporeal activity that is temporally and existentially prior to its perception.
	\item \emph{The attention of the mind (\emph{animi intentio})}. So far, Augustine's enumeration of the elements of perception has been reasonably familiar. We have been asked to distinguish the object of perception from the perception of it, at least as a perceptual realist would understand these notions. The novelty of Augustine's trinitarian account is the insistence on the third essential element involved in perceptual apprehension, \emph{animi intentio}. \emph{Animi intentio} means something like concentration or conscious attention. Augustine evidently believes that perception involves consciously attending to the object of the perceptual experience. Moreover, \emph{animi intentio} is conceived by Augustine to be the activity of a cognitive power. Augustine conceives of this power as the will of the soul to direct the mind to various objects. This activity does three things. It directs the sense outward toward the distal body, fixes the sense on that body and so gives rise to vision. It also sustains that vision---\emph{animi intentio} fixes the object of perception for long as it is seen.
\end{enumerate}

Having enumerated the elements of the perceptual trinity, Augustine immediately notes an important disanalogy with the archetype. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are, crucially, one substance. That God is three persons may be a truth of revealed theology, but Divine Unity is a truth of natural theology. However, the perceptual trinity involves two substances: (1) the object of perception understood as a body or corporeal activity independent of the perceiver and (2) the substance to whom the power of sight and its visual activity belong. The substance to which sense and vision belong, the living being, is a distinct substance from the material body or corporeal activity perceived. The disanalogy arises because perception is a trinitarian structure pertaining to the outer man.

Perception is a trinitarian structure pertaining to the outer man. The psychological capacities associated with the outer man include perception, memory, and imagination and these capacities are shared with non-rational animals. The exercise of memory or imagination may not require the presence of a body in the natural environment the way that perception does, but they retain a connection to the sensible and the corporeal through their dependence upon perception. Remembering a body may occur in that body's absence, but what is remembered derives from the image and likeness of the form of the body that arises in vision. Similarly the elements of imagination derive from images formed in perceiving bodies. It is the outer man's involvement with the corporeal that gives rise to this divergence from the archetype. No such divergence will arise for the trinitarian structures pertaining instead to the psychological capacities of the inner man. While Augustine cites Paul (2 \emph{Corinthians} 4:16) for the distinction between the inner and outer man, it has Platonic sources as well. In the \emph{Republic} (9 589 a 7), Plato personifies reason as the inner man with dominion over the whole man who must challenge the many-headed beast, associated with the sensible and the corporeal, with the aid of a lion. Plotinus, citing this passage, also distinguishes the inner and outer man, again, the former associated with reason, the latter with the sensible and the corporeal (\emph{Ennead} 1 1 10 15, 5 1 10 10). Only the inner man, the rational soul, is an image of God. Nevertheless, the trinitarian structure of perception, while not itself an \emph{imago Dei}, is like the Trinity, however imperfectly, for vestigial traces of the Trinity can be found in all created things (\emph{De trinitate} 11 1 1, for discussion of \emph{imago Dei} as conceived by Augustine see \citealt[chapter 11]{Gioia:2008zm}).

Consider the case of seeing a body such as a stone. Though the object of perception and the sense and vision differ in nature, since the object is a body and the perceptual power and its activity belong to the distinct substance of the living being, they are nevertheless united in perception. Like the Trinity, of which perception is a pale shadow, perception is a genuine unity. The object is united with the sense in vision, despite their difference in nature. That a perceived body and the sense that unites with it in perception differ in nature suggests that their unity is subject to further explanation if genuinely intelligible. To get that explanation into view, we must first understand how the elements of the perceptual trinity are arranged in ascending order of ontological dignity, and the explanatory relationships that obtain between them.

The object of perception, the stone, is a body. Moreover, it is an inanimate body. No life inheres in the stone as it lacks a soul. The sense that unites with the stone in the seeing of it, though bodily---it involves the eyes, and so belongs to the outer man---is animate and so not completely corporeal. By the sense, Augustine means the corporeal sense organ and the sensitive soul that animates it. Augustine describes the compound as a mixture, though it is doubtful that he means anything akin to a physical mixture, such as the blending of pigments. However this mixture is to be understood, unlike the stone, the sense that unites with that inanimate body is a living body compounded of the corporeal sense organ and the sensitive soul that animates it. In contrast with the body and the sense that unites with it, the \emph{animi intentio} is completely incorporeal. \emph{Animi intentio} is the exercise of a power of the immaterial soul. Though, on the trinitarian account, \emph{animi intentio} is an essential element of perception, should the perceiver lose their sense, by being blinded in an injury say, they would retain this power. It is just that, with the loss of sight, this power could no longer be directed upon the visible through the eyes. Thus the elements of the perceptual trinity are arranged in ascending order of ontological dignity, from the corporeal to a compound of the corporeal and the spiritual to the spiritual.

Assigning the elements of the perceptual trinity roles loosely analogous with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit reveals the explanatory relationships between them. Moreover, doing so introduces some refinements. These include a much needed clarification about the nature of vision, the activity of our perceptual power. All we know so far is that vision is the exercise of the soul's perceptual power and may take as its object a distal body or corporeal activity that is temporally and existentially prior to perception. We now learn that vision is a mode of assimilation:
\begin{quote}
	Since this is so, let us recall how these three, though differing in nature, may be fitted together into a kind of unity, namely, (i) the form of the body that is seen, (ii) its image impressed on the sense, which is vision, or the sense informed, and (iii) the will of the soul which directs the sense to the sensible thing and keeps the vision itself fixed upon it. (Augustine, \emph{De trinitate}, 11 2 5; \citealt[65]{Matthews:2002ly})
\end{quote}

Let us begin with a refinement concerning the object of perception. When the trinitarian account is first introduced, the object of perception is clearly presented as a body or corporeal activity. Later Augustine speaks of the object of perception as the form of the body (\emph{forma corporis}). Moderns might see this as an invitation to undertake what Thompson Clarke described as a surface inquiry, but perhaps this is overhasty. Augustine's position seems to be that in seeing a body, the perceiver sees is the form of the body. And in seeing the form of the body the perceiver sees the body. 

The refinement, here, allows Augustine to more clearly articulate the sense in in which the object of perception is the ``parent'' of perception (\emph{De trinitate} 11 5 9). The form of the body is the parent of perception insofar as perception involves the sense being in-formed by the form of the body seen. Seeing, the activity of the visual power, just is the in-forming of the sense in vision. Put another way, what Augustine describes as vision just is the sense taking on the form of the body in an image and likeness of that form. The refinement was needed to more clearly articulate vision as a perceptual mode of formal assimilation. In vision, the sense assimilates to the form of the body and the body impresses its form upon the sense as in the Peripatetic analogy of the signet ring impressing a seal upon the wax (Aristotle, \emph{De anima} 2 12 424\( ^{a} \)18–23). The form assimilated by the soul is an image and likeness of the body and is distinct from the form of the body, though these are indiscernable in ordinary cases of perceptual experience (\emph{De trinitate} 11 2 3). However, we can come to recognize their distinction in reflecting upon the phenomena of after images and double vision (\emph{De trinitate} 11 2 4). In the case of after images, the image and likeness of the body persists for a time after the form of the body is no longer present, the body being removed from view. Thus the image and likeness, which persists despite the body's absence, must be distinct from the form of the body.

The object of perception, in Augustine's example, the inanimate stone, is the Father insofar as it, in this sense, begets its perception. Perception, then, would be the Son, leaving \emph{animi intentio} as the Holy Spirit. However, as soon as he makes the crucial observation that determines the assignment of trinitarian roles, Augustine, importantly, qualifies it. It turns out that this qualification is the key to understanding the unity manifest by the perceptual trinity despite their difference in nature. The object of perception, the form of the body, is, at best, a quasi-parent and the perception, the subsequent vision, a quasi-offspring. Part of the point of the qualification is that the object of perception is not a total efficient cause of the perception. The sense may assimilate to the form of the body in vision. That is part of what licenses us to speak of the body as a quasi-parent and the vision as quasi-offspring. The body impresses its form onto the sense that receives it in an image and likeness of it. But the body is not causally sufficient for the occurence of vision. Augustine's idea is that in order for the form of the body to impress the sense, the sense must first be applied to the body. \emph{Animi intentio} fixing the sense to the body is a necessary precondition for the form of the body to impress an image and likeness upon the sense in vision. That is the function of Spirit in the guise of \emph{animi intentio}. 

This Augustinian doctrine, or a variant of it, will be subsequently expressed in an interesting metaphor of Robert Kilwardby's. Kilwardby gives a vitalist twist to the Peripatetic wax analogy by imagining life to inhere in the wax and to be actively pressing itself against the signet ring, \emph{De Spiritu Fantastico} 103. The will of the active wax, I take it, is a late Scholastic avatar of Augustine's \emph{animi intentio}. Kilwardby's image of active wax will be echoed by another late Scholastic Augustinian, Peter John Olivi, perhaps independently of Kilwardby, in \emph{Quaestiones in secondum librum Sententiarum} q. 58 415–16, 506–7; q. 72 35–6. Augustine's \emph{animi intentio} is an important source for Olivi's conception of \emph{aspectus}, but Olivi may have been drawing on non-Augustinian sources as well such as Alhazen (see \citealt[41 especially n. 43]{Tachau:1988aa}; for how Kilwardby and Olivi differently develop Augustinian materials see \citealt{Silva:2010zh}). 

Augustine describes \emph{animi intentio} as the will of the soul that directs the sense to the visible body. \emph{Animi intentio} plays at least three distinct roles in the \emph{De trinitate} account, \citep[81--82]{Silva:2014bh}. First, the will of the soul directs the sense outwards toward a distal body. That is, \emph{animi intentio} is the voluntary application of the visual sense to this distal body rather than some other. It is thus operative prior to the sense's assimilation of the form of the body in vision. Compare this with the activity of the Inchoate Intellect in Plotinus' account of ontogenesis in the \emph{Fifth Ennead}. The Incohate Intellect experiences its separation from the One as a profound loss. In seeking to reunite with the One, it turns, and looks, and sees only itself as an image of the hyperontic One thus becoming the Intellect in full actuality and establishing the domain of intelligible being. Notice that before the Inchoate Intellect sees, it must first turn and look. Second, \emph{animi intentio} unites the sense with the body in order to see it. It thus fixes the content of perception by directing the sense upon the object of perception. But having fixed the content of perception by directing the sense upon the object of perception, it may not safely withdraw from the scene. \emph{Animi intentio} is thus required, thirdly, to sustain that perception---it ``keeps the vision itself fixed upon it''. 

The form of the body is a quasi-parent since it may only inform the sense by the sense being applied to it by \emph{animi intentio}. In perceiving a body, the body and sense are bound together. As a consequence of their being bound together the sense formally assimilates to the form of the body and forms an image and likeness of it. What binds the body and sense together despite their differing in nature---while the former is a body the latter is a compound of body and soul---is the spiritual activity of the will of the soul that directs the sense to that body and so binds them. It is the will's binding the body and the sense that constitutes the unity of the perceptual trinity.

% (\citealt[]{Silva:2014bh}, as part of a reading of \emph{De trinitate} that seeks to reconcile it with the accounts of perception in \emph{De quantitate animae} and \emph{De musica}, argues for the stronger claim that not only is the form of the body not causally sufficient, but that it is not even among the efficient causes of perception.) 

% If Silva's \citeyearpar{Silva:2014bh} reconciliationist reading is correct, then Augustine anticipates, as well, Olivi's doctrine that the perceived object is a terminative cause and hence no efficient cause (on terminative causes see \citealt[192--195]{Kent:1984zm}, \citealt[chapter 5.2]{Pasnau:1997aa}, and \citealt[chapter 6]{Toivanen:2013ul}).

\section{Adapting the Augustinian Solution} % (fold)
\label{sec:adapting_the_augustinian_solution}

The Augustinian solution to our \emph{aporia} is attractive. Can we adapt it for ourselves?

I believe that once we adjust the lighting and remove some extraneous stage setting, we will be presented with a reasonable and attractive view.

Visual presentation is a kind of unity wherein the object of perception and the perceiver's experience of it are bound together.
